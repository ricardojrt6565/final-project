      <p>The class is dynamic, there are always new things to learn and what's best about this program is that it never gets old. Students who take this program are always ready to learn 
      something new and from being a student in this program, i'm always excited for the upcoming units. We started off with something easy, a program made by MIT students called: Scratch. We made many projects there and many successful games were made from it. 
      As we grew more familiar with the coding atmosphere, we moved on to more advanced things. For example <span style ="color:red">Processing </span>
where it was the first time we got familiar with hands on coding, no help like we did have during our Scrach days.      </p>
